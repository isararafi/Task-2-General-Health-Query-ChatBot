      "1. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: The most common cause of heart attacks. Plaque buildup in the arteries (atherosclerosis) narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**: Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries and contribute to atherosclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **High Cholesterol**: Elevated levels of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Smoking**: Smoking damages blood vessels, increases blood pressure, and reduces oxygen supply to the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Diabetes**: High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of atherosclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Obesity**: Excess weight increases the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, all of which contribute to heart attack risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Physical Inactivity**: Lack of exercise weakens the heart and contributes to other risk factors like obesity and high blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Unhealthy Diet**: Diets high in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium can contribute to heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Stress**: Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure and unhealthy behaviors like overeating or smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Family History**: A family history of heart disease increases the risk, as genetics can play a role.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Age and Gender**: Men over 45 and women over 55 are at higher risk, though heart attacks can occur at any age.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Sleep Apnea**: Untreated sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure and other heart-related problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption**: Heavy drinking can raise blood pressure and contribute to heart damage.\n",

      "4. **Dry Air**: Breathing dry indoor air, especially during winter months when heating systems are in use, can dry out the throat and cause irritation.\n",
